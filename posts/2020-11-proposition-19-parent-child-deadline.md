## Introduction

On November 3rd, 2020, California voters passed Proposition 19 ([ACA 11](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200ACA11)), which expanded property tax portability in exchange for limiting property tax inheritance. Portability means that old people can sell their house and buy a replacement and keep their low Proposition 13 assessment. Tax inheritance means that parents can transfer their low Proposition 13 assessment on to their children in certain circumstances. For more information about these provisions, see my [previous blog post](2017-10-transferring-prop13-assessed-value.html).

The California Association of Realtors® has long wanted to expand portability so that older folks could move to any house in any county because real estate agents benefit from increased turnover. However, their last attempt, Proposition 5 of [November 2018](http://vigarchive.sos.ca.gov/2018/general/), failed 60%-40% after the Legislative Analyst warned in the Voter Guide that it would cost local governments up to $1 billion per year. So the realtors needed to find a compromise that would pay for their desired portability expansion. Fortunately for them, an LA Times article showed that many people who inherit a house keep the low tax assessment but rent out the property for profit, including an actor from the movie _The Big Lebowski_ (1998) ([Liam Dillon and Ben Poston, “California Homeowners Get to Pass Low Property Taxes to Their Kids: It’s Proved Highly Profitable to an Elite Group,” Los Angeles Times, August 17, 2018](https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-california-property-taxes-elites-201808-htmlstory.html)), and have no need of a subsidy to operate their rental business. So this year the Realtors® came back with Proposition 19, which is a compromise that will raise more revenue by curtailing the inheritance exclusion, and will dedicate funding to firefighting efforts. It won endorsements from almost everybody who opposed Proposition 5 two years ago, and voters barely approved Proposition 19 with approximately 51%-49% ([ballot measure results](https://electionresults.sos.ca.gov/returns/ballot-measures)).

Theoretically this change makes property taxes more targeted; it’s better to give a discount to seniors, disabled people, and victims of a disaster rather than to heirs who most likely don’t need any subsidy on top of their inheritance. However, in their infinite wisdom, the legislature made the provisions apply starting February 16, 2021, which gives parents time to adjust their estate plan to minimize the tax burden on their family. This blog post examines some of the options that people have to act before Proposition 19 goes into effect.


## How does Proposition 19 change the rules for parent-child transfers?

Proposition 19 severely limits the exclusion from reassessment for parent-child and grandparent-grandchild transfers.

Before Proposition 19, parents could transfer their house of unlimited value to their child without the assessment going up. And parents could also transfer a vacation house or commercial property or rental property to their children of a combined total of $1 million of assessed value (which could be much less than the market value) without reappraisal.

After Proposition 19, only the parent’s principal residence, called the “family home”, is excluded from reassessment to market value, and even on that house only the first $1 million is excluded from reassessment. In addition, the child must move into the house and claim the homeowner’s exemption within one year of the transfer. If multiple siblings inherit the house, then each transferee must live in the house, or else their portion will be reassessed to market value.

Although Proposition 19 requires the child to live in the house within one year, they are allowed to move out without reassessment. Be thankful that it was not more restrictive; a separate proposal, [SCA 3](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200SCA3) (2020), which was not approved, would have triggered a reassessment the moment that the child who inherited a house later moved out. But don’t plan on moving in for only a few months to receive the tax break; if a child moves in only for the tax break and then moves right back out, the assessor may invoke the “step transaction doctrine” and combine the steps into one.

Proposition 19’s restrictive inheritance rules become effective for transfers that happen after February 16, 2021. That means **the deadline for parent-child and grandparent-grandchild transfers under the old rules is February 15, 2021.** If you have rental or vacation properties that you want to transfer to your children, or if your children will not be moving into the house within one year, then you must transfer them on or before the day after Valentine’s Day in order for the child to pay the same property taxes as the parent!

This table summarizes the changes to the inheritance exclusion from reassessment in Proposition 19:

## Workarounds for limitation on inheritance of assessments

If your only property is a home that is assessed at under $1 million that your child will live in after you die, then your house qualifies as a “family home” under Proposition 19, and you have nothing to worry about. But if you do have other property, then the only way to avoid Proposition 19’s new changes is to act fast before it applies.

There are typically two types of taxes to consider for parent-child transfers: the property tax (typically about 1.2%) and the federal and state capital gains tax (15% or 20% federally, and your ordinary invite bracket on the state). Once the parent gives the child a property, if the child wants to hold onto the property, then the property taxes are more important and the capital gains taxes may be irrelevant. If the child wants to sell the property, then the capital gains taxes will be more important and his property tax assessment will be irrelevant.

If the child will sell the property after inheritance, then you may just want to put the child in the will or trust. This is advantageous because the federal capital gains step-up in basis requires you to transfer the property upon death, not earlier ([26 USC §1014](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1014), [IRS Publication 551](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p551#idm140486307579360)). The child’s property tax will go up when he inherits a property other than a family home, but it doesn’t matter if he sells the property. If the step-up basis still exists at the time of death, then the child will sell the house and pay no capital gains taxes. But be warned that President-Elect Biden has promised to eliminate the stepped-up basis ([Matthew Yglesias (Dec. 5, 2019), Joe Biden’s plan to raise taxes on corporations and the rich, explained](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/12/5/20995225/joe-biden-tax-plan)).

If the child will keep the property, then it may be better to transfer the deed on or before February 15, 2021 while the old rules still apply. The parent can gift the property to the child, in which case the child will have the same capital gains basis as the parent but will be on the hook for capital gains taxes when he sells. Or the parent can sell the property to the child at fair market value, in which case the parent will have to pay the capital gains taxes. Generally speaking, the first $250,000 of gains per person are excluded from capital gains taxes if the house was the seller’s primary residence for 2 of the past 5 years ([IRS Pub 523](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-publication-523), [FTB: Income from the sale of your home](https://www.ftb.ca.gov/file/personal/income-types/income-from-the-sale-of-your-home.html)), or, for an investment property, then the seller may be able to defer capital gains taxes using a 1031 Exchange. Either way, the transfer is excluded from change in ownership for property taxes if you do the transfer on or before February 15th, 2021, and fall within the old limits.

The parent can do a blend of selling and gifting by selling at a price between the two. If the parent sells the property at a price above his tax basis but below the current fair market value, then the parent and child will share the capital gains tax burden. For example, the parent may choose to sell his home to his child at a price of the purchase price plus $250,000, in which case the child will owe no extra property tax, the parent will owe no capital gains tax, and the child will owe capital gains taxes of the difference between his purchase price and sale price when he sells.

Another option to potentially reduce capital gains taxes is to spread the purchase over time. The child can purchase the property from the parent with an installment agreement over 30 years. The change in ownership for property taxes would happen on the date of the purchase agreement, which can be excluded from parent-child transfer if done before February 16, 2021. Then the parent will pay capital gains taxes each year rather than all at once, and if the stepped-up basis still exists when the parent dies, then the remaining balance will be stepped up to market value, reducing the child’s eventual capital gains tax.

There are a couple more esoteric options that you can pursue with your tax attorney to transfer the property before February 16, 2021 for property tax purposes but not for capital gains tax purposes. In the definition of “change in ownership” in [RTC 61](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=RTC&sectionNum=61.), it says the parent could make a long-term lease to the child (a lease with options to renew for more than 35 years), or the parent could give a life estate of income or occupancy to the child, and this would be considered an immediate “change in ownership” for property tax purposes but may allow the child to defer “acquiring” for income tax purposes.


## Conclusion

Proposition 19’s new rules for the parent-child and grandparent-grandchild exclusion from change in ownership give parents an incentive to expedite their estate plan. You have until the day after Valentine’s Day to transfer your property under the old rule, which allowed transfers of non-principal residence property and did not require the child to live in the house. But don’t stress your old folks out too much; remember that the extra 1.2% property tax on the gains and 15% capital gains taxes are much smaller than the principal. And family relationships are more important than property. But if you are comfortable having a discussion about succession plans, then this may be an interesting topic of conversation this Thanksgiving.
