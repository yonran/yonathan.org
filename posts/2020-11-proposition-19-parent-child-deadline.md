## Introduction

On November 3rd, 2020, California voters passed Proposition 19 (a.k.a. [ACA 11](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200ACA11)), which expanded property tax portability in exchange for limiting property tax inheritance. Portability (a.k.a. “base year value transfer”) means that old people can sell their house and buy a replacement and keep their low Proposition 13 assessment. Tax inheritance (a.k.a. the exclusion from reassessment for parent-child and grandparent-grandchild transfers) means that parents can transfer their low Proposition 13 assessment on to their children in certain circumstances. For more information about these provisions, see my [previous blog post](2017-10-transferring-prop13-assessed-value.html).

The California Association of Realtors® has long wanted to expand portability so that older folks could move to any house in any county because real estate agents benefit from increased turnover. However, their last attempt, Proposition 5 of [November 2018](http://vigarchive.sos.ca.gov/2018/general/), failed 60%-40% after the Legislative Analyst warned in the Voter Guide that it would cost local governments up to $1 billion per year. So the realtors needed to find a compromise that would pay for their desired portability expansion. Fortunately for them, an LA Times article showed that many people who inherit a house keep the low tax assessment but rent out the property for profit, including an actor from the movie _The Big Lebowski_ (1998) ([Liam Dillon and Ben Poston, “California Homeowners Get to Pass Low Property Taxes to Their Kids: It’s Proved Highly Profitable to an Elite Group,” Los Angeles Times, August 17, 2018](https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-california-property-taxes-elites-201808-htmlstory.html)), and there’s no public purpose in giving one set of landlords a subsidy compared to other landlords merely because they happened to inherit their property. So this year the Realtors® came back with Proposition 19, which is a compromise that will raise more revenue by curtailing the inheritance exclusion and will dedicate funding to firefighting efforts. It won endorsements from almost everybody who opposed Proposition 5 two years ago, and voters barely approved Proposition 19 with approximately 51%-49% ([ballot measure results](https://electionresults.sos.ca.gov/returns/ballot-measures)).

This change makes the property tax cap somewhat better targeted at those who need it; seniors, disabled people, and victims of a disaster are more in need of a tax discount than heirs who inherit a valuable property. However, in their infinite wisdom, the legislature made the provisions kick in on February 16th, 2021, which gives parents a little bit of time to adjust their estate plan to minimize the tax burden on their family. This blog post examines some of the options that people have to act before Proposition 19 goes into effect.


## How does Proposition 19 change the rules for parent-child transfers?

Proposition 19 severely limits the exclusion from reassessment for parent-child and grandparent-grandchild transfers.

Before Proposition 19, parents could transfer their house of unlimited value to their child without the assessment going up. And parents could also transfer a vacation house or commercial property or rental property to their children of a combined total of $1 million of assessed value (which could be much less than the market value) without reappraisal. (Propositions 58 and 193, [Const. Article XIII A Section 1](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=CONS&division=&title=&part=&chapter=&article=XIII%20A)(h), [RTC 63.1](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=RTC&sectionNum=63.1.))

After Proposition 19, only the parent’s principal residence, called the “family home”, is excluded from reassessment to market value, and even on that house only the first $1 million (of assessed value) is excluded. In addition, the child must move into the house and claim the homeowner’s exemption within one year of the transfer. Depending on how the legislature implements the constitutional amendment, if multiple siblings inherit the house, then each transferee may have to live in the house, or else their portion will be reassessed to market value.

Proposition 19’s restrictive inheritance rules become effective for transfers that happen after February 16th, 2021. That means **the deadline for parent-child and grandparent-grandchild transfers under the old rules is February 15th, 2021.** If you have rental or vacation properties that you want to transfer to your children, or if your children will not be moving into the house within one year of the date that they receive the property, then that transfer will trigger a reassessment to market rate. If you want the child to pay the same property taxes as the parent on vacation or rental properties, then you must transfer them on or before the day after Valentine’s Day!

## Should you transfer property to a child before Proposition 19’s effective date?

If your only property is your home that is assessed at under $1 million that your child will live in after you die, then your house qualifies as a “family home” under Proposition 19, and you have nothing to worry about. But if you do have other property, then the only way to avoid Proposition 19’s new changes is to act fast before it applies.

There are typically two types of taxes to consider for parent-child transfers: the property tax (typically about 1.2% per year) and the federal and state capital gains tax (15% or 20% federally, and the ordinary income bracket for state taxes of typically around 10%). Once the parent gives the child a property, if the child wants to hold onto the property indefinitely, then the property taxes are more important and the capital gains taxes are irrelevant. If the child wants to sell the property right away, then the capital gains taxes will be more important and his property tax assessment will be irrelevant. You might also owe federal estate tax and gift tax if your estate is above $11.7 million.

If the child will sell the property after inheritance, then you may just want to keep the property in a trust with the child as a beneficiary like normal. This is advantageous because the federal capital gains step-up in basis requires you to transfer the property upon death, not earlier ([26 USC §1014](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1014), [IRS Publication 551](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p551#idm140486307579360)). The child’s property tax will go up due to Proposition 19 when he inherits a property other than a family home, but if he will sell the property right away, then the property tax won’t matter. If the step-up basis still exists at the time of death, then the child will sell the house and pay no capital gains taxes. But be warned that President-Elect Biden has promised to eliminate the stepped-up basis ([Matthew Yglesias (Dec. 5, 2019), Joe Biden’s plan to raise taxes on corporations and the rich, explained](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/12/5/20995225/joe-biden-tax-plan)).

If the child will keep the property other than a “family home”, then it may be better to transfer the deed on or before February 15, 2021 while the old rules still apply. The parent can gift the property to the child, in which case the child will have the same capital gains basis as the parent so will be on the hook for capital gains taxes when he sells. Or the parent can sell the property to the child at fair market value, in which case the parent will have to pay the capital gains taxes. Generally speaking, the first $250,000 of gains per person are excluded from capital gains taxes if the house was the seller’s primary residence for 2 of the past 5 years ([IRS Pub 523](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-publication-523), [FTB: Income from the sale of your home](https://www.ftb.ca.gov/file/personal/income-types/income-from-the-sale-of-your-home.html)), or, for an investment property, then the seller may be able to defer capital gains taxes using a 1031 Exchange. Either way, the transfer is excluded from change in ownership for property taxes if you do the transfer on or before February 15th, 2021, and fall within the old limits.

The parent can do a blend of selling and gifting by selling at a price between the two. If the parent sells the property at a price above his tax basis but below the current fair market value, then the parent and child will share the capital gains tax burden. For example, suppose two parents bought their home for $500,000, and it is now worth $1.2 million. The two parents can sell their house to their child for $1 million, in which case the child will owe no increased property tax, the parent will owe no extra capital gains tax (since a married couple can exclude a gain of $500,000), and at the time that the child sells the house, the child will owe capital gains taxes on his gains above $1 million, including the $200,000 that was partially a gift ([26 CFR 1.1015-4](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/26/1.1015-4)).

Another option to potentially reduce capital gains taxes is to spread the purchase over time. The child can purchase the property from the parent with an installment sale (a.k.a. seller financing) over 30 years. The change in ownership for property taxes would happen right away on the date of the purchase agreement, which can be excluded from parent-child transfer if done before February 16, 2021. Then the parent can elect to pay capital gains taxes each year rather than all at once ([IRS Pub. 537](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-publication-537)), which can reduce capital gains taxes compared to an up-front sale which would raise the parent’s income tax bracket. And if the stepped-up basis still exists when the parent dies and the property is not paid off, then the remaining balance will be stepped up to market value, reducing the child’s eventual capital gains tax.

There are a couple more esoteric options that you can pursue with your tax attorney to transfer the property before February 16th, 2021 for property tax purposes but not for capital gains tax purposes. In the definition of “change in ownership” in [RTC 61](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=RTC&sectionNum=61.), it says the parent could make a long-term lease to the child (a lease with options to renew for more than 35 years), or the parent could give a life estate of income or occupancy to the child, and this would be considered an immediate “change in ownership” for property tax purposes but may allow the child to defer “acquiring” for income tax purposes.

If you have property that you wish to transfer to a child that does not qualify for Proposition 19 because it is not your principal residence, the child does not want to move in within one year, or it is assessed at more than $1 million, then consider transferring the property before Proposition 19 takes effect on February 16th, 2021.


## What loopholes still exist after Proposition 19 becomes effective?

If you are reading this message after Proposition 19 goes into effect on Feb. 16th, 2021, then it’s too late. Only the principal residence of the parent and child qualifies for the parent-child exclusion. Many of the tricks that I mentioned in the [previous blog post](http://2017-10-transferring-prop13-assessed-value.html), including the tricks to transfer property held by a trust long after the parent’s death, probably won’t work anymore. But there are a few tricks from that post that you still can use. For example:

When a parent dies and her house is in a trust, the trustee can still arrange for one of the children to receive the house while the other children inherit cash. But due to Proposition 19, the child must move in within one year for the transfer to be excluded from change in ownership.

A child who inherits a family home is still allowed to move out and rent out the house later. Unlike an alternate proposal to close the inheritance loophole for rental properties that did not pass the legislature ([SCA 3](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200SCA3)), Proposition 19 does not require that the child live in the house he inherited continuously. However, if the child moves in only for the parent-child exclusion and then moves out right away, then the assessor may combine the suspicious steps into a single step under the “step transaction doctrine” and reappraise the property.

You can still transfer a principal residence to your child multiple times in your life, so you can transfer one house to a child, move into another house, and transfer that one to a child too. But you can’t plan to move into each property for tax purposes, or else the assessor may combine the suspicious steps into a single step under the “step transaction doctrine” and reappraise one or both of the houses.

You can still use tax portability to change the percentage ownerships with a third party, so you can sell your old house and buy a new house with someone else as co-owner to partially transfer the low assessment to them. Proposition 19 adds flexibility here by allowing you to purchase any house in any county.

But for any property that the parent does not live in the time of transfer, you’re out of luck.


## Conclusion

Proposition 19’s new rules for the parent-child and grandparent-grandchild exclusion from change in ownership give parents an incentive to expedite their estate plan. You have until the day after Valentine’s Day to transfer your property under the old rule, which allowed transfers of non-principal residence property and did not require the child to live in the house. But don’t stress your old folks out too much; remember that the extra 1.2% property tax per year on the gains and 25% capital gains taxes are much smaller than the principal. And family relationships are more important than property. But if you are comfortable having a discussion about succession plans, then this may be an interesting topic of conversation this Thanksgiving.
